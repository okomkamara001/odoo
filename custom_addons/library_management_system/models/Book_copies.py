copies with the internal name _name set to 'book.copies'
 and a description _description set to 'books.copies'.
 These lines define different fields in the book.copies model:
name: A character field to hold the name of the book copy.
book_id: A many-to-one field that establishes a relationship with the books.data model.
It represents the book associated with the copy.
state: A selection field that allows the user to choose the state of the book copy (lost, borrowed, or available).
start_date: A datetime field that holds the starting date of the book copy.
end_date: A date field that represents the end date of the book copy.
It is computed based on the start_date and duration fields.

#     Represents an author in the book management system.
#
#     This class inherits from the 'models.Model' class provided by the Odoo framework.
#     It extends the functionality of the base model to include additional fields and methods specific to authors.
#
#     Attributes:
#         _name (str): The technical name of the model.
#         _inherit (list): A list of names of parent models to inherit from.
#         _description (str): A description of the model.
#
#     Fields:
#         name (Char): The name of the author.
#         date_of_birth (Date): The date of birth of the author.
#         image (Image): An image representing the author.
#         salary (Integer): The salary of the author.
#         email (Char): The email address of the author.
#         phone_number (Char): The phone number of the author.
#         book_ids (Many2many): The books associated with the author.
#         color (Integer): A color code for the author.
#     Note:
#         - The 'name' field is a required field.
#         - The 'date_of_birth' field represents the birth date of the author.
#         - The 'image' field stores an image file for the author.
#         - The 'salary' field stores the salary of the author.
#         - The 'email' field stores the email address of the author.
#         - The 'phone_number' field stores the phone number of the author.
#         - The 'book_ids' field establishes a many-to-many relationship with the 'books.data' model.
#         - The 'color' field stores a color code for the author.
